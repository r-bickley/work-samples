Selected Jupyter notebooks with examples of analysis, figure creation, using deep learning data products
DSOM-vis-32.ipynb -- I used a custom deep self organized map (DSOM) to simultaneously identify and organize the latent space for a graph dataset. I use the DSOM to identify meaningful trends by projecting metadata from other sources onto the map.
paper_figs_test_dec28.ipynb -- I extract, transform, analyze, and visualize multiple data sources to create visualizations for an academic paper.
test_all_aug7.ipynb -- I combine deep learning data products of my own creation with external tabular data to create visualizations for a paper investigating the role of image quality in limiting the efficacy of CNNs.
